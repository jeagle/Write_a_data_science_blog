# Exploring Airbnb data of New York
Udacity project analyzing Airbnb data of NYC and using machine learning to try predict price.

## Installations
The project is done in Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda).
Pyton 3.6.

## Motivation
Udacity project

"Follow the CRISP-DM method for, preparing, analyzing, model and visualizing data and answering three business related questions. Create a blog post to share your insights to a non-technincal audience."

Business questions:

* What quantitative features has the most impact on the price?
* Can we see any differences in what makes an impact on the price in the airbnb-market comparing Manhattan and Brooklyn?
* Can we predict the airbnb price using machine learning?

## Summary
The analysis was strictly based on quantitative features in the dataset i.e. possibly excluding a lot of important features. 
I only compared two districts; Manhattan and Brooklyn and listings other than whole apartments/homes where excluded.

I found that features regarding number of beds/bedrooms(accomodation) is very important in explaining the price. 
I also concluded that in order to get better results using the algorithms Linear Regression and Random Forest I should have put in more features.
